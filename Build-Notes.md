#### Creating Mechanics
- Images are not minted until images are purchased (Digital Fingerprints "Revealed After Purchase"). *Inform Users about Free NFT Creation/Minting process*
- PAP price calculated 50x from price listed by creator (After Sale: You Keep... 50%, Buyer Keeps... 47%, Fees... 3%)...
- 1 Blockchain (Polygon)--- This is automatically chosen for buyer... prices in USDC
- Create AUM Tracker (for all Current Prices)
                                                
#### Buying Mechanics:
- Once an NFT is bought, the new price is 50xed from original price.
- Implement PAP Algo (After Sale: You Keep... 7%, Creator Keeps... 90%, Fees... 3% + Mint Fee)

#### After Purchase:
 1. "Purchased... PAP: $, List For Sale? [List][DeList]{Both Open Modal} (On Buyer)... (Nothing Shows in Public Buyer)".
 2. If Yes, then "Add-to-Cart", if No then "Collected" (On Seller)
 5. Message (notifications) to seller: "Congratulations xxxx! Art Sold to xxxx for xxxx, new PAP: xxxx"
 6. If/Then messages corresponding to above messages. 
 
#### LinkTree Links.

#### Before AWS Upload (research how to reset server... or is it better to wait for server to reload (changing times of TTL, etc))
  
##### "Welcome! You are now a pioneer of a store that will revolutionize everything. Before Arells, you could lose money on anything you sold, but thanks to our Price After Purchase system, all this changes. So congratulations, because after today, not just the artworld, but finance will change forever... *Thanks to Arells, buyers of your artwork will never lose money if they ever choose to sell your artwork, this means more money not just for you, but for your prospective buyers!*"
