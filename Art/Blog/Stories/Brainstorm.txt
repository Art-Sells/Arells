Update 5:

From TrainTracks to TrainEngine

Arells Infrastructure (Ecare)'s original vision is turning 
out to be more like a Train Engine than the Train Tracks that will power Arells 

While working on Ecare, it was discovered that 
sifting not only from one Building tool to another, but re-writing 
entire API channels to new Blockchain Wallets that encompass their own unique
price monitoring mechanics is much more descriptive of engine components... 
 
Challenging times have surely arrived.

But with these challenges come opportunities to improve, adapt, and innovate.

Ready, set, build.
