# Arells Build Notes...

## Arells Cryptocurrency Marketplace MVP

## Arells 1.0

### Testing
- - - Bakkt (pending approval)
- **Possibly a Blockchain Info (with API) to pull Bitcoin to Buy & Sell?**
- Test Buying, Selling|Depositing process first...
- - Separate Bitcoin Wallet Page where handleBuy, handleSell handle changes from and to first.
- - handleBuy/handleSell (add try, awaits and catch to ensure the entire process is successful before contextHandleBuy and contextHandleSell is initiated)



  #### Start Buying (Page)
 - Connects to Plaid First, (if not connected)
 - - Sell/Buy shows if bankAccount !== null


### Sell
**Test to see if it'll sell if over amount?**
- (B) Amount Available To Sell
- - amount: displays acVactsAts
- - Profits: displays acdVatops
- - Sell Amount Input: (tel no * or #) see HPMTester
- - Sell: see HPMTester
- - (Confirm Sale) -> Modals
- - - Modals: 
- - - - Confirming Sale...3 Second delay
- - - - Sale Complete (confirming sale modal = false) (see HPMTester) (View Account) -> Account
- - - - Transaction Failed (confirming sale modal = false) (OK)
- - - - Enter information (if one or more fields are empty)
- Reloads modules every 10 seconds (price, wallet, and profits animation css) from coin gecko API wrapper?


#### Test Amplify/S3 Login


### Other (if Time Permits)
- Fix (signOut /sign-up/log-in issue) loading  after button click success stays true forever... add "await"?
- Fix (View Account) slowness issue (Add Preparing Account loading we time out at least 2 seconds before this loads)
- emailConfirmed attribute
- - if null, emailUnConfirmed(true){}, emailConfirmed(false){};
- - if true, opposite
- Send Confirmation (Link) look into Hosted UI in AWS Copgnito for custom UI interface Emails, etc..

### Last Resort
- Create separate Wallet to handle where we get our 3% fee... (Stripe?)
- Remove console.logs from all components, hide "wallettester" and "hpmtester" from main
- Resolve Google/Bing/Yahoo Search Tab issues (Add Metatags to all recurring pages)







































## Arells 1.5 - 2

### Important:
- Update Blockchain.info API to Amplify (IP) API
- Resolve "HPMContext" errors that show "cannot find email, Error fetching Bitcoin Price, etc etc" from console.log if pages don't need them...

- Sign up for 2 more Exchange APIs then begin aggregating our own Cryptocurrencies (set into plan)â€¦
