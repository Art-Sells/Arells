## Never lose money selling cryptocurrencies.

Arells exists because it believes ***it's wrong for investors to lose money selling their cryptocurrencies, especially during Bear Markets.***

### Solution:
A cryptocurrency marketplace that helps render bear markets obsolete. Arells is working on achieving this through an innovation called **Holding Price** which limits the erasure of a token's value from selling pressure.

#### Holding Price:
Holding Price is a market system which holds the price of a token as it loses value.

**Example Scenario:**

A Token at the Price of $10 is bought with an investment of $500.
- Token Price falls to $9 and the investment to $450.
- Holding Price implemented and token selling locked.
- Token Price is held $10 and the investment at $500.
- Token Price rises to $11 and the investment to $550.
- Holding Price is revoked and token selling unlocked.
- Investor sells token and gains $50 in profits.

This introduces a new marketâ€¦

#### Sloth Market:

A market in which token prices stagnate rendering bear markets obsolete.

## FAQ:

***What if I'd like to sell my investment regardless of price?***
You'll be able to transfer your investment out of Arells and into other marketplaces and exchanges.

***How would transferring my finances out of Arells impact my investment?***
If the token price (outside the parameters of the Holding Price) decreases, the value of your investment will also decrease. The transfer fees of the network (whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency) will be also be evident.
