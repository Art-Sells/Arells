# [Arells](https://arells.com)
## An NFT store that financially empowers artists.

#### Problem:
Most Artists are living in poverty.

#### Solution:
Art + Sells = Arells: An NFT store that financially empowers artists. Arells plans on achieving this by offering each artist 90% royalties for each NFT sold.

***Note: Arells has taken a massive pivot away from protocol development and into the NFT marketplace... And thus, the below Roadmap is to-be-refactored soon to reflect this new pivot in strategy.***
