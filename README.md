# [Arells](https://arells.com)
## An NFT store in which you can't lose money on any sale.

#### Problem:
Most Artists are living in poverty.

#### Solution:
Art + Sells = Arells: An NFT store in which you can't lose money on any sale. Arells is working on achieving this through an innovation called **Price After Purchase** which introduces a new market called a Stag Market.

_______________________________________________________________________

#### Price Afer Purchase:
Price After Purchase or PAP for short is a market system which assets cannot be sold lower than the price they were either listed or previously purchased for which introduces a new market...

#### Stag Market:
A market in which no new assets are bought or sold but rather stagnate rendering bear markets obsolete.
