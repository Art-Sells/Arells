- Contact CSC (TAX)

## 2 days after launch
- Start tracking after 2 days (numbers)
- After Week 1, if things look good, X-prsnl
- - Call CoingeckoAPI (research how it calls it, maybe to update the VAPA info?) every 5 seconds, not on page mount...
- Prepare for WACA transition (LTP folder)

## 1 mnth and beyond:
- Fix long marketcap numbers and summary section (in asset pages sometimes not saving the number info on state so it can height up after investment deletions, which causes a pop-up, in my investments page it sometimes doesn't smoothly fade in and out numbers like in asset pages after button clicks..)....
- (Sort)MarketCap/etc sorting (default by Marketcap always)
- Wait at least 2 months to adjust LTP based on feedback...
- - If traction is good look at LTP folder post WACA
- - increase CG API limit? (track)
- - Compare Retention rate (in bear markets WoM only (percentages)) : Projections (with current trajectory) with/without (WoW percentage comparisons)
- Figure out way to save .JSON info into another very secure section (possibly offline for added security)
