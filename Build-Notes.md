#### Creating Mechanics
- Images are not minted until images are purchased (Digital Fingerprints "Revealed After Purchase").
- PAP price calculated 50x from price listed by creator (After Sale: You Keep... 90%, Buyer Keeps... 7%, Fees... 3%)...
- 1 Blockchain (Polygon)--- This is automatically chosen for buyer... prices in USDC
                                                
#### Buying Mechanics:
- Once an NFT is bought, the new price is 50xed from original price.
- Implement PAP Algo (After Sale: You Keep... 7%, Creator Keeps... 90%, Fees... 3% + Mint Fee)

#### After Purchase:
 1. "Purchased... PAP: $, List For Sale? [List][DeList]{Both Open Modal} (On Buyer)... (Nothing Shows in Public Buyer)".
 2. If Yes, then "Add-to-Cart", if No then "Collected" (On Seller)
 5. Message (notifications) to seller: "Congratulations xxxx! Art Sold to xxxx for xxxx, new PAP: xxxx"
 6. If/Then messages corresponding to above messages.
