Cendentralized Blockchain:::::::::
-----Centralized Blockchain (to prove which nodes [proven by identity verification] can create the tokens)
-----Decentralized Blockchain (to create a distributed system secure from 51% attacks)

Every new User will be a node.
Transactions settled by many nodes
Creators of tokens are those who successfully join the ecosystem (Arells Storytellers), their accounts are the token creation tools.

TOTAL SUPPLY/CIRCULATING SUPPL

Total Supply: Created In Ecosystem (Those that are exchanged into fiat by Businesses/Individuals/Us are all automatically burned, 
by the Arells consensus token mechanism) (Plaid) to automatically link Bank Accounts...

Circulating Supply: One token to Swap for another to increase Markec Cap
**Must have specific Address only to swap Arells tokens for other token**

1. (logo) *create your* Address (look at Stellar addresses (arells.com/username))
2. (logo) *create your* Key (can be a multitude of words and/or numbers(20 letters long) (copy and save this to at least 3-4 different places)

Non-transactional currency

---Layer 3:
We hold .50 of each 1 token created (that the user can see) for tax purporses at the end of the year, and we release it at the end of the fiscal year (ADD Tax Notice).


---Layer 2:
2.50( tokens created when a user adds 1 picture/video onto another user's life story.
1 token distributed into the user's wallet .
1 token distributed into the other user's wallet
.40 tokens distributed into Govermnental debt Wallet.
.10 for internal exchange (to raise token value)

---Layer 1: 
1.25 tokens created when a user adds 1 picture/video onto their life story.
1 token distributed into the user's wallet
.20 tokens distributed into Govermnental debt Wallet.
.05 for internal exchange (to raise token value)

Profits will initially need to be 0% (increase how many tokens created dependent on whether capital is raised or not)
in order to scale platform quickly....
(dependent in price corelation *Will definitelly need economists/mathmeticians to work this out*)

Code this into "Network protocol":


   1 Add (My Life Story) + 9 Contributions(Other Life Stories) or 10 Page Contributions(Other Life Stories) Per Day.
    (when trying to contribute/add more than 10 pages, 
(message: We believe everyone should have a fair shot to earn money, so to battle income inequality, we allow a maximum of 10 page contributions (10 arells earned) per person, per day.))

(User only sees and has access to tokens distributed into his/her wallet)

Images and Videos can't be deleted, only hidden...

For Exchange/Website Addresses: (arells.com/exchangename-websitename/email-username)
For Exchange/Website Keys: (Any Words/Letters/Prefixes Websites Deem)




SUPPLY(initial dollars exchanged for currency):
Start off supply small, then once new tokens are generated, supply dilutes price per token 
(until more tokens are exhanged)
