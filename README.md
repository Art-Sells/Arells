## Always sell Bitcoin for Profits.

Arells exists because it believes ***investors should never lose money selling assets***, especially during Bear Markets.

### Solution:
A Bitcoin marketplace that ensures investors will always make profits selling assets. Arells is working on achieving this through an innovation called:

## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Holds the highest price of an asset after its import or purchase limiting the erasure of its value thus introducing new mechanisms to help it achieve this feat:

### HPAP = Highest Price After Purchase
- Changes based on the highest cpVatop, otherwise 0

### Vatop = Value At Time Of Purchase
- **cVatop** = Corresponding Vatop (the value of your Bitcoin investment at time of purchase/import)
- **cpVatop** = Corresponding Price Vatop (the price of Bitcoin at time of purchase/import)
- **cdVatop** = Corresponding Difference Vatop (cVact - cVatop = cdVatop)
- **acVatops** = All cVatops (Combines all cVatops)
- **acdVatops** = All cdVatops (combines all cdVatops only if positive, otherwise 0)

### Vact = Value At Current Time
- **cVact** = Corresponding Vact (the value of your Bitcoin investment based on the current Bitcoin price, this is updated consistently based on the current Bitcoin price)
- **cVactTa** = cVact Token Amount (reflects the amount of Bitcoin at time of purchase/import)
- **acVacts** = All cVacts (combines all cVacts)
- **acVactTas** = All cVactTas (combines all cVactTas)
- **acVactTaAts** = acVactTa Available To Sell (combines all cVactTas if acVactsAts > 0)
- **acVactsAts** = acVacts Available To Sell (combines cVacts only if the cdVatops > 0)

#### Example:

1. Bitcoin Price: $60,000
 - $500 worth of Bitcoin is purchased/imported
 - HPAP = $60,000
 - Vatop Group 1
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $500
 - - cVactTa 1 = 0.00833 
 - - cdVatop 1 = $0
 - Vatop Group Combinations
 - - acVatops = $500
 - - acVacts = $500
 - - acVactTas = 0.00833
 - - acdVatops = $0
 - - acVactsAts = $0

2. Bitcoin Price: $54,000
 - $600 worth of Bitcoin is purchased/imported
 - HPAP = $60,000
 - Vatop Group 1
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $450 
 - - cVactTa 1 = 0.00833

 - - cVatop 2 = $600
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $611
 - - cVactTa 2 = 0.01111
 - - cdVatop 2 = $11
 - Vatop Group Combinations
 - - acVatops = $1,100
 - - acVacts = $1,069
 - - acVactTas = 0.01941
 - - acdVatops = 11
 - - acVactsAts = $611

4. Bitcoin Price: $65,000

 - - cdVatop 1 = $42
 - Vatop Group 2
 - - cVatop 2 = $600
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $722
 - - cVactTa 2 = 0.01111
 - - cdVatop 2 = $122
 - Vatop Group 3
 - - cVatop 3 = $200
 - - cVatopTa 3 = 0.00308
 - - cpVatop 3 = $65,000
 - - cVact 3 = $200
 - - cdVatop 3 = $0
 - Vatop Group Combinations
 - - acVatops = $1,300
 - - acVacts = $1,464
 - - acVatopTas = 0.02249
 - - acdVatops = $164 
 - - acVactsAts = $1,264

5. Bitcoin Price: $63,000
 - $650 worth of Bitcoin is sold
 - HPAP = $65,000
 - Vatop Group 1
 - - cVatop 1 = $0
 - - cpVatop 1 = $0
 - - cVact 1 = $0
 - - cVactTa 1 = 0
 - - cdVatop 1 = $0 
 - Vatop Group 2
 - - cVatop 2 = $450
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $575
 - - cVactTa 2 = 0.00198
 - - cdVatop 2 = $125 
 - Vatop Group 3 
 - - cVatop 3 = $200
 - - cpVatop 3 = $65,000
 - - cVact 3 = $194
 - - cVactTa 3 = 0.00308
 - - cdVatop 3 = -$6  
 - Vatop Group Combinations
 - - acVatops = $650
 - - acVacts = $769
 - - acVactTas = 0.00506
 - - acdVatops = $119 
 - - acVactsAts = $575 

## This introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamicsâ€¦

- **Solid Marketplace: an illiquid marketplace that constrains the flexibility of selling assets erasing bear markets.**
- **Sloth Market: a market in which asset prices stagnate.**

### How It Works: https://arells.com/howitworks
_______________________________________________________________________

## FAQ:

***What if I'd like to sell my investment regardless of price?***
You'll be able to transfer your investment out of Arells and into other marketplaces and exchanges.

***How would transferring my finances out of Arells impact my investment?***
If the token price (outside the parameters of the Holding Price) decreases, the value of your investment will also decrease. The transfer fees of the network (whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency) will be also be evident.
