## Never lose money selling cryptocurrencies.

Arells exists because it believes ***it's wrong for investors to lose money selling their cryptocurrencies, especially during Bear Markets.***

### Solution:
A cryptocurrency marketplace that helps render bear markets obsolete. Arells is working on achieving this through an innovation called **HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)**.

## HPM
Holds the highest token's price after purchase limiting the erasure of its value thus introducing new mechanisms to help it achieve this feat:

### Vatop = Value At Time of Purchase
- **cVatop** = Corresponding Vatop
- **cpVatop** = Corresponding Price Vatop
- **acVatops** = All cVatops

### Vact = Value At Current Time
- **cVact** = Corresponding Vact
- **acVacts** = All cVacts

#### Example:

1. Bitcoin Price: $60,000
 - $500 worth of Bitcoin is purchased
 - HPM = $60,000
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $500
 - - - acVatops = $500
 - - - acVacts = $500

2. Bitcoin Price: $54,000
 - $600 worth of Bitcoin is purchased
 - HPM = $60,000
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $450 
 - - cVatop 2 = $600
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $600
 - - - acVatops = $1100
 - - - acVacts = $1050

3. Bitcoin Price: $55,000
 - No Bitcoin is purchased
 - HPM = $60,000
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $458
 - - cVatop 2 = $600
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $611
 - - - acVatops = $1100
 - - - acVacts = $1069

4. Bitcoin Price: $65,000
 - $200 worth of Bitcoin is purchased
 - HPM = $65,000
 - - cVatop 1 = $500
 - - cpVatop 1 = $60,000
 - - cVact 1 = $542
 - - cVatop 2 = $600
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $722
 - - cVatop 3 = $200
 - - cpVatop 3 = $65,000
 - - cVact 3 = $200
 - - - acVatops = $1300
 - - - acVacts = $1464

5. Bitcoin Price: $63,000
 - $650 worth of Bitcoin is sold
 - HPM = $65,000
 - - cVatop 1 = $0
 - - cpVatop 1 = $0
 - - cVact 1 = $0
 - - cVatop 2 = $450
 - - cpVatop 2 = $54,000
 - - cVact 2 = $575
 - - cVatop 3 = $200
 - - cpVatop 3 = $65,000
 - - cVact 3 = $194
 - - - acVatops = $650
 - - - acVacts = $769

## This introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamicsâ€¦

- **Solid Marketplace: an illiquid marketplace that constrains the flexibilities of buying and selling assets.**
- **Sloth Market: a market in which asset prices stagnate.**

### How It Works: https://arells.com/howitworks
_______________________________________________________________________

## FAQ:

***What if I'd like to sell my investment regardless of price?***
You'll be able to transfer your investment out of Arells and into other marketplaces and exchanges.

***How would transferring my finances out of Arells impact my investment?***
If the token price (outside the parameters of the Holding Price) decreases, the value of your investment will also decrease. The transfer fees of the network (whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency) will be also be evident.
