“Financial Security Guideline":

At Arells, we’ve created extremely secure safeguards to protect your funds from theft from our 2fa login and KYC/AML sign-up process, to our *link*insurance policy*. Nevertheless, theft is still possible so in order to increase the security of your funds, we’ve provided you with some extremely important guidelines in order to prevent such a scenario:

1. Always check the domain from which you receive emails/text-messages from us: The more financially successful you become on Arells, the more scammers/criminals will try to coerce you into logging into your account via another website link. So remember to always verify that the link to any email/text-message we send you links to our domain *arells.com* or directly to our App.

3. Always ensure any Arells App you download is an accredited Arells App created

4. Always download updates to our App frequently.

If you follow these guidelines strictly while we protect you with our automated security protocols, you’ll ensure that your finances are protected with utmost scrutiny.
