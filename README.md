## Buy art that never loses value.

### Problem:
Most people are struggling financially.

### Solution:
Art + Sells = Arells: A digital asset marketplace that obscures bear markets. Arells is working on achieving this through an innovation called **Price After Purchase** which renders bear markets obsolete.

#### Price Afer Purchase:
Price After Purchase is a market system which assets cannot be sold lower than the price they were either listed or previously purchased for.

**Example:**

Created artwork sells for $500.
- Artist keeps: $485
- Arells keeps: $15
- Buyer owns: The Artwork
- Price After Purchase: $1,000

Old Buyer sells the artwork for $1,000.
- Artist keeps: $400
- Arells keeps: $30
- Old Buyer keeps: $570
- New Buyer gets: The Artwork
- Price After Purchase: $2,000

This introduces a new marketâ€¦

#### Snail Market:

A market in which no new assets are bought or sold but rather slows rendering bear markets obsolete.
